## Navigating The Website
The **[Projects](/projects/)** section includes both academic and personal work. Each project page begins with a summary intended as a portfolio showcase, followed by a detailed report. The **[Research](/research/)** section contains pages dedicated to what Iâ€™m currently researching or learning, along with relevant documentation Iâ€™d like to share. The **[Blog](/blog/)** section features my posts from Google Summer of Code 2024, as well as newer, more general blog entries.
