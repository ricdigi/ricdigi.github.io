As of my latest update, I have submitted a pull request to modify the implementation of `find_dynamicsymbols()`, aiming to correct its current behavior.

### Current Implementation's Issues

- If a dynamic symbol $ q(t) $ appears only as a child of a derivative node $ \text{Derivative}(q(t), t) $, the current implementation returns both $ q(t) $ and $ \frac{dq(t)}{dt} $, while only $ \frac{dq(t)}{dt} $ should be returned.
- If an unevaluated derivative of another sub-expression $ f $ is present, such as $ \text{Derivative}(f(q_1(t), q_2(t), \ldots)) $, the old implementation returns only $ q_1(t), q_2(t), \ldots $, and not the correct time derivatives of those variables.

### About the Proposed Modification

The new proposed implementation successfully addresses these issues while maintaining performance comparable to the old implementation. However, the PR received the following feedback:

- This modification might cause backward compatibility issues. Many users' codes may rely on the current behavior, and changing it now could break their code, which is undesirable.

Thus the updated strategy is:

1. Modify the docstring of the current implementation to fully describe its behavior.
2. Implement a new function with the updated behavior.
    - Test the robustness of the new implementation.

### My Thoughts

Iâ€™m confident that the proposed solution is the way to go. However, I will postpone further work on `find_dynamicsymbols()` to focus on my primary GSoC project, which is improving performance in the mechanics module. I still plan to include `find_dynamicsymbols()` in my GSoC work but at a later stage.
