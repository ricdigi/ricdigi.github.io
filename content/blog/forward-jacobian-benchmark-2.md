### **Feedback on Initial Benchmarking**

After conducting the first benchmark, I received constructive feedback regarding the methodology used. The primary concerns were that my approach lacked a proper function warm-up, which is essential to prevent one-time initializations and late imports from affecting the timing. Additionally, I had not included a cache-clearing step, which could lead to skewed results.

### **How I Addressed the Feedback**

To improve my workflow, enhance flexibility, and ensure repeatability, I decided to create a dedicated repository for testing and benchmarking various forward Jacobian implementations. You can find it here: [Jacobian Benchmark Repository](https://github.com/ricdigi/jacobian_benchmark). This repository includes:

- Utility functions to warm up the function before timing it, ensuring more accurate benchmarking.
- Various models for generating input expressions, such as SymPy’s `n_link_pendulum_on_cart()` and a bicycle model from J.P. Meijaard et al. (DOI: [10.1098/rspa.2007.1857](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2007.1857)).
- Functions for plotting benchmark results.
- Multiple implementations of the forward Jacobian function for comparison.
- Unit tests using pytest to verify the correctness of the results.

### **Benchmark Details**

In the second round of benchmarking, I tested multiple implementations of the `forward_jacobian` function, including:

- The classic Jacobian function.
- Sam Brockie’s implementation.
- A similar implementation developed by me.
- An implementation based on `protosym`, a faster Python core of SymPy.
- An implementation using `symengine`, a C-based core of SymPy.

Each of these implementations was tested against the two input models. Detailed results are available [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/26730#issuecomment-2199939076).

### **Results and Conclusions**

The benchmarks showed that the implementations based on `protosym` and `symengine` were the fastest. However, since these cores are not yet fully developed, they may fail with certain expressions, making them less robust for diverse inputs.

Among the other implementations, both Sam’s and my versions showed promising performance. However, I found that Sam’s implementation struggles when working directly with expressions containing `sympy.mechanics: dynamicsymbols()`. Since my main goal is to optimize methods within SymPy Mechanics, compatibility with `dynamicsymbols` is a crucial requirement.
