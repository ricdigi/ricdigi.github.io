This PR introduces a modification to the `find_dynamicsymbols()` function in the `physics.mechanics` module.

### Reasons

1. The current function returns both the derived and underived dynamicsymbols when called on an expression containing only the derivative of a dynamicsymbol.
2. The function fails to return the dynamicsymbol with the correct derivative order when that dynamicsymbol is found inside an unevaluated time derivative in a SymPy expression.

### Examples

Example of problem 1

```python
expr = sm.Derivative(q2, t)
print(me.find_dynamicsymbols(expr))

# Output
{q2(t), Derivative(q2(t), t)}

# q2(t) should not be present
```

Example of problem 2

```python

# Define the reference frame
N = me.ReferenceFrame('N')

# Define the dynamicsymbols
t = me.dynamicsymbols._t
u1, u2, u3, u4 = me.dynamicsymbols('u1 u2 u3 u4')
q3, q4 = me.dynamicsymbols('q3 q4')

# Define the constants
a, c, d = sm.symbols('a c d')

# Define the velocity vector N_v_Ao
vel_vec = u1 * N.x + u2 * N.y
acc_vec = vel_vec.diff(t, N)

# Create the replacement dictionary
q4_dot = q4.diff()
qd_repl = {q4_dot: u4}

# Create the replacement dictionary for u1(t) and u2(t)
ur_repl = {
    u1: (a * u3 * sm.sin(q3) * sm.sin(q4) + c * u3 * sm.cos(q3 + q4) + d * u3 * sm.cos(q3) + d * u4 * sm.cos(q3)) / sm.sin(q4),
    u2: (-a * u3 * sm.sin(q4) * sm.cos(q3) + c * u3 * sm.sin(q3 + q4) + d * u3 * sm.sin(q3) + d * u4 * sm.sin(q3)) / sm.sin(q4)
}

# Checking for dynamic symbols
print(me.find_dynamicsymbols(acc_vec.xreplace(ur_repl).to_matrix(N)))
print(me.find_dynamicsymbols(acc_vec.xreplace(ur_repl).to_matrix(N).doit()))

# Output
without doit(): {q4(t), u4(t), q3(t), u3(t)}
when doit(): {Derivative(u4(t), t), u4(t), q3(t), u3(t), Derivative(q4(t), t), q4(t), Derivative(q3(t), t), Derivative(u3(t), t)}

# Lead to different results when using doit() or not
```

### Solutions

1. One solution to address point 2) is to use `.doit()` on the expression, which evaluates all unevaluated derivatives. However, this approach can result in long execution times for complex expressions and does not resolve point 1). (TODO - Is this behavior desirable?)
2. Another solution is to implement a function that traverses the expression tree once, checking for conditions to identify dynamicsymbol nodes. During traversal, the function can track encountered operation nodes (*, /, +, -) and function nodes (e.g., `sm.sin`, `sm.Pow`, `sm.log`). This approach should yield a faster and more robust function. It potentially reduces execution time due to fewer traversals compared to the current implementation which traverses twice.

### Detailed Explanation of Chosen Solution â†’ Solution 2

https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/manipulation.html

Definition of two functions, which are meant to check any expression tree node, and determine if that node represents an istance of a **dynamicsymbol** (`dyn_sym(node)`) or a **derivative** of time **of** any order of a **dynamicsymbol** (`der_dyn_sym(node)`).

```python
# Rule 1)
def dyn_sym(node):
    if isinstance(node, AppliedUndef):
        t=me.dynamicsymbols._t
        return node.free_symbols == {t}
    return False

# Rule 2)
def der_dyn_sym(node):
    if isinstance(node, sm.Derivative):
        args0 = node.args[0]
        t=me.dynamicsymbols._t
        if isinstance(args0, AppliedUndef):
            return args0.free_symbols == {t}
    return False
```

**NOTE**

At the moment the current imlpementation of **find_dynamicsymbols()** uses the **atoms()** function in **basic.py**, which transform the tree in a list through the **preorder_traversal(expr)** function in **traversal.py** (Depth-First Search) from which, afterwards, the nodes of interest can be extracted. However this implementation has the problem explained above in the **reasons section** above. Moreover, the current implementation perform the traversal basically 2 times, while only one could be enough for this purpose.

Likewise my implementation has to traverse the tree. To achieve the objective with just one traverse, a custom preorder_traverse() function has to be written, which along traversing checks the conditions (1 and 2) above. Thus at the core of the function there is a recursive part.

```python
def find_dynamicsymbols(expression, exclude=None, reference_frame=None):
    """
        Find all dynamicsymbols in expression.

        Explanation
        ===========

        If the optional ``exclude`` kwarg is used, only dynamicsymbols
        not in the iterable ``exclude`` are returned.

        If we intend to apply this function on a vector, the optional
        ``reference_frame`` is also used to inform about the corresponding frame
        with respect to which the dynamic symbols of the given vector is to be
        determined.

        Parameters
        ==========

        expression : SymPy expression

        exclude : iterable of dynamicsymbols, optional

        reference_frame : ReferenceFrame, optional
            The frame with respect to which the dynamic symbols of the
            given vector is to be determined.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import dynamicsymbols, find_dynamicsymbols
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import ReferenceFrame
        >>> x, y = dynamicsymbols('x, y')
        >>> expr = x + x.diff()*y
        >>> find_dynamicsymbols(expr)
        {x(t), y(t), Derivative(x(t), t)}
        >>> find_dynamicsymbols(expr, exclude=[x, y])
        {Derivative(x(t), t)}
        >>> a, b, c = dynamicsymbols('a, b, c')
        >>> A = ReferenceFrame('A')
        >>> v = a * A.x + b * A.y + c * A.z
        >>> find_dynamicsymbols(v, reference_frame=A)
        {a(t), b(t), c(t)}

If instead you also consider the time spent in the doit() process:

    sm.Derivative(q[9] * sm.exp(q[9] * t), t) + sm.Derivative(sm.cos(q[9] * t), t, t)

Another example:

```python
# Create a complex expression
expr = (sm.Derivative(sm.sin(sm.Derivative(sm.Derivative(1/(q1 + q2)*(q1*q2**2)) *
sm.Derivative(1/(q3 + q4)*(u1*u2**2)))+ u3) + u4/sm.Derivative(1/(q1 + q2)*(q1*q2**2))))
