**Hi! Iâ€™m Riccardo Di Girolamo, a recent MSc Mechanical Engineering graduate from TU Delft, currently focused on building a career in robotics engineering.**

This website is my portfolio â€” a place to showcase my projects, share self-directed research, and document what I learn. My goal is to track my progress while creating resources that might help others exploring robotics and engineering. Along the way I will probably, casually add sections about other passions of mine as well.
<br>

**About the Sections**
In the <strong><a href="#" onclick="loadPage('projects.md'); return false;">Projects</a></strong> section you can find a collection of reports of academic and personal projects. In the <strong><a href="#" onclick="loadPage('research.md'); return false;">Research</a></strong> section, you can find sub-sections related to what I am researching or learning at the moment, and relevant documentation I want to share. In the <strong><a href="#" onclick="loadPage('blog.md'); return false;">Blog</a></strong> section you can find my old posts written during the Google Summer of Code 2024, and newer, more general blog posts.
