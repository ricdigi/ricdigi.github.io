**Hi! Iâ€™m Riccardo Di Girolamo, a recent MSc Mechanical Engineering graduate from TU Delft, specializing in Mechatronics. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a career in robotics engineering.**
This website is my portfolio â€” a place to showcase projects, share self-directed research, and document what I learn. My goal is to track my progress while creating resources that might help others exploring robotics and engineering. Along the way, Iâ€™ll probably, casually, add sections about my other passions too.
<br>

**About the Sections**
In the <strong><a href="#" onclick="loadPage('projects.md'); return false;">Projects</a></strong> section, youâ€™ll find reports on both academic and personal projects. The <strong><a href="#" onclick="loadPage('research.md'); return false;">Research</a></strong> section contains sub-sections related to what Iâ€™m currently researching or learning, along with relevant documentation Iâ€™d like to share. The <strong><a href="#" onclick="loadPage('blog.md'); return false;">Blog</a></strong> section features my posts from Google Summer of Code 2024, as well as newer, more general blog entries.
